"I'm facing multiple issues with my Supabase setup in my chat and likes feature.

1. Chat Issue (PGRST116: JSON object requested, multiple (or no) rows returned)
Problem:

When trying to start a conversation, Supabase returns an error:
pgsql
Copy
Edit
JSON object requested, multiple (or no) rows returned
This happens because the query expects a single row, but either no chat exists or multiple rows are returned.
Expected Fix:

Modify the query to properly handle cases where no chat exists.
Instead of select('*'), use .maybeSingle() to avoid errors.
Suggested Fix:

ts
Copy
Edit
const { data, error } = await supabase
  .from('chats')
  .select('*')
  .eq('id', chatId)
  .maybeSingle(); // This prevents the multiple/no rows error.
2. Likes Not Counting Correctly (1,2,3,4,...)
Problem:

Each like should be counted separately, but the current logic prevents multiple likes from being added.
Expected Fix:

Allow multiple likes (Don't check for an existing like, just insert a new row).
Count total likes correctly.
Suggested Fix:

Insert a new like without checking for existing ones:
ts
Copy
Edit
const { data, error } = await supabase
  .from('user_likes')
  .insert([{ user_id: userId, liked_user_id: likedUserId }]);
Get the correct total like count:
ts
Copy
Edit
const { count, error } = await supabase
  .from('user_likes')
  .select('*', { count: 'exact', head: true })
  .eq('liked_user_id', likedUserId);
3. Supabase API Returning 406 Not Acceptable Error
Problem:

API calls to Supabase (/rest/v1/user_likes and /rest/v1/chats) fail with 406 errors.
This means Supabase cannot process the request due to incorrect headers or query parameters.
Expected Fix:

Ensure the Accept header is set to application/json:
ts
Copy
Edit
const { data, error } = await supabase
  .from('user_likes')
  .select('*')
  .eq('user_id', userId)
  .eq('liked_user_id', likedUserId)
  .single(); 
Check Supabase policies (RLS rules) to ensure the user has permission to access the data.
Final Fix Summary:
✅ Use .maybeSingle() in chat queries to prevent the PGRST116 error.
✅ Allow multiple likes by inserting directly without checking.
✅ Use { count: 'exact', head: true } to get accurate like counts.
✅ Ensure API requests have correct headers (Accept: application/json).
✅ Verify that Row-Level Security (RLS) is correctly configured in Supabase.
