Here’s a short and detailed summary of what we did to fix the issue with your messages table and RLS (Row-Level Security) policies:

1. Identified the Problem
The error new row violates row-level security policy occurred because:

Missing or incorrect RLS policies for the messages table.

Redundant or conflicting policies were present.

Public access was allowed for some operations, which is insecure.

2. Verified Table Structure
Ensured the messages table has the correct structure:

sql
Copy
CREATE TABLE messages (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT uuid_generate_v4(),
  conversation_id UUID NOT NULL REFERENCES conversations(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
  sender_id UUID NOT NULL REFERENCES users(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
  content TEXT NOT NULL,
  is_read BOOLEAN DEFAULT FALSE,
  created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW()
);
3. Enabled RLS
Enabled Row-Level Security on the messages table:

sql
Copy
ALTER TABLE messages ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
4. Removed Redundant Policies
Dropped redundant or conflicting policies:

sql
Copy
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can insert messages" ON messages;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can view messages" ON messages;
5. Added Correct RLS Policies
Added secure and granular RLS policies for the messages table:

sql
Copy
-- Allow authenticated users to read messages in conversations they are part of
CREATE POLICY "Users can read their messages"
ON messages FOR SELECT
TO authenticated
USING (EXISTS (
  SELECT 1 FROM conversations
  WHERE conversations.id = messages.conversation_id
  AND (conversations.user1_id = auth.uid() OR conversations.user2_id = auth.uid())
));

-- Allow authenticated users to send messages in conversations they are part of
CREATE POLICY "Users can send messages"
ON messages FOR INSERT
TO authenticated
WITH CHECK (EXISTS (
  SELECT 1 FROM conversations
  WHERE conversations.id = messages.conversation_id
  AND (conversations.user1_id = auth.uid() OR conversations.user2_id = auth.uid())
));

-- Allow authenticated users to update their own messages
CREATE POLICY "Users can update their messages"
ON messages FOR UPDATE
TO authenticated
USING (sender_id = auth.uid());

-- Allow authenticated users to delete their own messages
CREATE POLICY "Users can delete their messages"
ON messages FOR DELETE
TO authenticated
USING (sender_id = auth.uid());
6. Verified the Fix
Checked the updated policies:

sql
Copy
SELECT * FROM pg_policies WHERE tablename = 'messages';
Tested the policies to ensure they work as expected:

Users can only read, send, update, or delete messages in conversations they are part of.

Users can only update or delete their own messages.

7. Ensured Authentication
Verified that only authenticated users can perform operations on the messages table.

8. Final Testing
Tested the following scenarios:

Reading messages in conversations the user is part of.

Sending messages in conversations the user is part of.

Updating and deleting only the user’s own messages.

Ensuring users cannot access or modify messages in conversations they are not part of.

Outcome
The messages table now has secure and correct RLS policies.

Users can only interact with messages in conversations they are part of.

Users can only update or delete their own messages.

Public access is restricted, ensuring data security.
