✅ Remaining Tasks for Full Real-Time Chat System
🔥 Make sure to not make any syntax or import mistakes. The UI must already be available—use that.

1️⃣ Frontend Integration
🔹 Connect the database logic to the UI

Ensure UI components are wired to fetch, send, and display messages.
The chat input field should support text, images, emojis, and file uploads.
🔹 Real-Time Message Updates

Use listenForNewMessages(chatId, callback) to update messages in real time.
Ensure new messages appear instantly without refreshing the page.
🔹 Read Receipts (Seen Messages)

Call markMessageAsSeen(messageId, userId) when a message is opened.
Show ✓✓ (double tick) for seen messages.
🔹 New Message Notifications

Display alert badges or sound alerts when new messages arrive.
2️⃣ User Presence & Status
🔹 Online/Offline Tracking

Call setUserOnline(userId) when a user opens chat.
Call setUserOffline(userId) when a user closes chat or logs out.
Use listenForUserStatus(callback) to update the UI when users go online/offline.
🔹 Last Seen Implementation

Display "Last seen at [time]" for offline users.
Ensure it updates when a user goes offline.
3️⃣ Chat Room Functionality
🔹 Allow Users to Create New Chats

UI should include a "New Chat" button to start conversations.
Insert a new row in the chats table when a new chat is created.
🔹 Show Active Chats

Fetch all chats where user_id is involved.
Display the chat list in the sidebar.
🔹 Lazy Loading Messages

Fetch only the latest 20 messages when opening a chat.
Implement scroll-to-load older messages.
4️⃣ Media Uploads (Images, Files, Emojis)
🔹 Enable Image/File Upload

Store images/files in Supabase Storage.
Modify sendMessage() to support media uploads.
🔹 Emoji Picker

Use an emoji picker component in the UI.
Ensure emojis are properly displayed in messages.
5️⃣ Final Testing & Deployment
🔹 Test Everything:

Real-time messaging ✅
Online/offline tracking ✅

Read receipts ✅
File & emoji support ✅

🔹 Deploy on Replit & Ensure No Syntax Errors

📌 Replit Execution Notes
💡 When sending to Replit, mention:
1️⃣ DO NOT modify database schema or break existing imports
2️⃣ UI must already be available—connect the backend only
3️⃣ Ensure real-time events are correctly handled
4️⃣ No unnecessary logs or debug statements in production

🚀 Once done, let me know if you need extra features!
